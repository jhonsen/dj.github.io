Welcome!   
  
This is the story of my journey into the world of AI.
  
I am data scientist with a background in chemistry research. As a chemist, I employed both experimental and computational techniques to solve protein structures and infer their functions. As an experimentalist, I studied protein structures using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (a branch of physics & chemistry that deals with deciphering select electromagnetic signals). As a computational chemist, I built molecular models of proteins and simulated their behaviors using supercomputers (high-performance computing centers). These data-driven research eventually led me to the world of data science (DS) and machine learning (ML).  
  
After my post-doctoral work, I decided to hone my skills in coding & data analysis by attending a (fulltime) 12-week DS bootcamp in Seattle, [METIS](https://www.thisismetis.com/). At the bootcamp, I completed multiple end-to-end data science projects, focusing on business problems that intersect various industries, e.g., healthcare, marketing, sports analytics. 

I love building and productionizing machine learning and AI. This interest led me to taking up a role as a Conversational Data Specialist with the Semantic Machines team at Microsoft,

_Excited and looking forward to whatever comes next!_
