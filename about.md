  Welcome!   

  This is my story of entering world of DATA.

  I am data scientist with a background in chemistry research. I was trained in both experimental techniques and computational approaches, to solve molecular structures and infer their functions. As an experimentalist, I analyzed protein structures using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (a branch of analytical techniques that deals with extracting signals from noise). As a computational chemist, I built molecular models of the proteins and simulated their behaviors using packages that run on Linux clusters and supercomputers. 
  These data-driven research eventually led me to the world of data science (DS) and machine learning (ML).  
  
  After graduate school, I decided to hone my analytical & coding skills by attending a (fulltime) 12-week DS bootcamp in Seattle, i.e., METIS. At the bootcamp, I completed five end-to-end projects that focused on real-world business problems that intersect multiple industries, e.g., healthcare, marketing, sports analytics. 

  Currently, I'm also in pursue of a _data engineering_ nanodegree (via UDACITY), to support my adventures through this exciting world of DATA.
